/**
 * Creates a CodeObj by loading info from a code image in memory.
 *
 * An image is a static representation of a Python object.
 * The process of converting an object to and from an image
 * is also called marshalling.
 * In PyMite, code images are the equivalent of .pyc files.
 * Code images can only contain a select subset of object types
 * (None, Int, Float, String, Slice?, Tuple, and CodeImg).
 * All other types (Lists, Dicts, CodeObjs, Modules, Classes,
 * Functions, ClassInstances) are built at runtime.
 *
 * All multibyte values are in Little Endian order
 * (least significant byte comes first in the byte stream).
 *
 * memspace and *paddr determine the start of the code image.
 * Load the code object with values from the code image,
 * including the names and consts tuples.
 * Leave contents of paddr pointing one byte past end of
 * code img.
 *
 * The code image has the following structure:
 *      -type:      8b - OBJ_TYPE_CIM
 *      -size:      16b - number of bytes
 *                  the code image occupies.
 *      -argcount:  8b - number of arguments to this code obj.
 *      -stacksz:   8b - the maximum arg-stack size needed.
 *      -nlocals:   8b - number of local vars in the code obj.
 *      -names:     Tuple - tuple of string objs.
 *      -consts:    Tuple - tuple of objs.
 *      -code:      8b[] - bytecode array.
