==================
The Posix Platform
==================
Formerly known as "desktop"
===========================

Purpose
-------

This is a sample project that demonstrates running Python-on-a-Chip on the
desktop.  Any POSIX-compliant OS should work (Mac OS X, Linux, Cygwin).


Building the Project
--------------------

Start with a clean source tree.

If you are running on a 64-bit processor, you will need to increase the
heap size by editing ``src/platform/posix/main.c`` near line 18 to set
``HEAP_SIZE`` to a value ``0x4000`` or larger that is a multiple of four::

    #define HEAP_SIZE 0x4000

The posix desktop is the default platform of the SCons build system,
so typing ``scons`` in the root directory will build a binary to run on the
posix platform::

    $ scons

The resulting binary is found in ``src/platform/posix/build/main``.
At present, the main.py program prints some heap information, a hello world
message and raises a ZeroDivisionError.
