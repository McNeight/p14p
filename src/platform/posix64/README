====================
The Posix64 Platform
====================
Formerly known as "desktop" or "desktop64"
==========================================


:Author:    Dean Hall


Purpose
-------

This is a sample project that demonstrates running Python-on-a-Chip on a
64-bit POSIX-compliant terminal.  Any POSIX-compliant OS should work
(Mac OS X, Linux, Cygwin).


Building the Project
--------------------

Start with a clean source tree.

The posix64 platform is the default platform of the SCons build system,
so typing ``scons`` in the root directory will build a binary to run on the
posix64 platform::

    $ scons

The resulting binary is found in ``src/platform/posix64/build/main``.
Presently, the main.py program runs the interactive prompt (ipm).
To launch the vm on your posix64 target and connect to it, type this::

    $ src/tools/ipm.py --desktop
